hey, help structure and write a cofiguration reposition with whish I'd like to be able to reproduce my setup preferablyy painlessly :)

I've collected some configs for this session into a 'dot' repo: https://github.com/whysosergious/dot

no configs are active on my windows machine and I have a fresh install with Debian.

I'll test out the scripts on these as we go. need to add nu binaries (for mac, linux, windows and android), into the init dir so we can run'install.nu' to fetch installations of rustup toolchain and after use cargo to really install nushell and install/ build other things we needd.
